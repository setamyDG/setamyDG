### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
As a teenager, I never thought that â€˜knowledge is the ultimate power toolâ€™ would become my motto. But here I am now â€” working at Codetain and learning from really awesome senior developers. I spend my evenings gaming with my friends, reading thrillers or developing my own projects. Lately, I found out that there is no such a thing as enough knowledge for a good programmer. But itâ€™s ok! I love coding and learning something new every day. If Iâ€™m not taking programming courses, Iâ€™m probably taking pictures for my photography portfolio. I like having different hobbies. Actually, having extremely various interests is a common thing at Codetain! Oh, and as a true resident od lubuskie province, Iâ€™m a huge fan of Å¼uÅ¼el (en. speedway)! ðŸ˜„. Feel free to send me a message ðŸ’¬!
